Welcome to the Evvnt Engineering Blog! This is our hello world introducing Evvnt and what we do.
First things first, it's not a typo! The company name is Evvnt and it's pronounced Event. (We don't blame you if you pronounce it like [marwage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3odMTPuzLwY).)

Our Passion: **Powering Experiences to Connect People**

*People Value Social Interaction Through Local Events that Vitalize Communities and Improve Life Quality*

Q: Why haven't I heard of Evvnt?
A: Today we deliver our software as white labeled service. We are on thousands of media sites powering their event calendars and sell millions of dollars in tickets.

Q: What makes Evvnt different from any other software company out there?
A: We believe in the following values that we embody every day:

#### Values

* *Transparency* - we talk about what we do and why at every level in the company
* *Respect* - we believe that each and every person deserves respect and we demonstrate it daily.
* *Ownership* - we believe that a team that owns the company and outcomes is more motivated and makes better decisions.
* *Quality at Pace* - we believe that quality wins over speed and our development philosophy is "To Always Be Shipping" (ABS). We goal is to build great things that are sustainable and compounding.
* *Integrity* - What you do when no one else is looking matters.
* *Constant Improvement* - If we can improve ourselves, how we work, the product, the company a little bit each day we can go to great places.
* *Customer Focus* - We believe the customer holds the keys to our success and their feedback drives our prioritization
* *Fun* - We believe that we work to support our lives and that life is too short to not enjoy our time together. This means we make space for having fun. And that no meeting is complete without something funny being said.

#### Quality at Pace

While all of our values are important and make up who we are, the one that truly sets us apart from other software companies is *Quality at Pace*.

What does Quality at Pace mean as a software products team? The best way to answer that is to hear from the team.

> Quality at Pace means we are an agile team that practices Kanban. We don't sprint! 
> I've seem more quality issues from Sprints. The pressure of the deadline is important for pace, but it often produces 
> sweep it under the rug engineering. We consciously want quality. Things are not done until they work as the they should. 
> This goes for every part of the process. Quality at pace also means we don't talk about deadlines, we talk about priority and order.
> When something makes it into the development queue, you know it will ship as soon as its possible with high quality.
> If you are a great engineer/product manager/tester and are sick of the treadmill of Agile Sprints, and you have the 
> self discipline to stay focused then Evvnt might be the right place for you.
> 
> -Russell Edens, CTO

> To me, quality at pace means buying future agility by taking the time now to _fully_ understand problems, brainstorming an ideal solution (not the quickest!), testing thoroughly against well-understood requirements, and tying up loose ends to meet the true definition of "done". It also means not rubber-stamping pull requests and instead taking the time to dive into the deeper implications of a set of changes.
> Building on top of a robust foundation by prioritizing quality _over_ pace leads to everything on top of the foundation being built that much quicker and that much sturdier.
>
> -Nick Miller, Senior Software Engineer

> I feel _Quality at Pace_ is a practice shared by all skilled craftsmen, whatever the trade. It means fully understanding the problem and the
> needs of all stakeholders. It means planning ahead, carefully choosing a solution that satisfies the requirements, but recognizes we can't work 
> on one thing indefinitely. It means doing it right the first time and building on a solid foundation. It also means prioritizing the work that 
> will move the product forward and satisfy our long term goals.

> For product managers, "Quality at Pace" (QAP) sets Evvnt apart from other companies that use Agile Sprints. 
> Agile Sprints result in high daily stress levels to deliver products, features, enhancements based on timelines that are projected from sizing epics, stories, tasks, and spikes. 
> However, more often than not, the sales team usually puts pressure on product managers to "deliver" on customer driven deadlines ASAP. 
> The product manager relays this pressure on to engineers, who, when push comes to shove, choose to ship software that is not of a high quality and/or engage in death marches working around the clock to meet deadlines that are often artificial. 
> This then results in never ending cycles of fixing broken software after it has been released. 
> This buggy software distracts engineers from working on the next exciting feature/sprint. 
> Future sprints and sprint planning are affected as a result, which then requires the team to spend significant time on replanning. 
> Teams eventually burn out. This is a classic case of "Pace over Quality" (POQ).
> 
> Evvnt chooses QAP with "Always Be Shipping" (ABS) over POQ. 
> This means all functional areas of the company as well as our Customers are informed about our philosophy, which allows us to manage external and internal expectations about software delivery deadlines, thus allowing us all to have fun while delivering high quality software.
